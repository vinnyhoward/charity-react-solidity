# Project Summary
This is a personal project aimed at educating and familiarizing myself with the Solidity language for smart contracts for the Ethereum blockchain, while interacting with the data with React.js.

The smart contract allows users to donate to a charity, which in this case is a 'mock charity', and write an endearing message of their choice which will forever be on the block chain. 

## Features Include
- User  can submit an amount of Eth 
- User can write their name
- User can write a message
- All messages can be seen from prior users
- Custom modal and loader
- Modal error handling
